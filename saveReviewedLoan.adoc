== Assignment 9

Review and save loan Content

In this assignment, we're going to save a loan content. This exercise will allow to complete the
use case of loan content review and approval from the loan edit dialog.

=== View
In the application, the dialog to edit loan content is shown when the logged in user clicks on the context menu option
for 'Edit Loan Content' displayed on right-click of a loan document
If the user is a loan officer, the user can proceed to enter the fields for the loan status approval trait
and then click the finish button to save the existing loan applying the trait. The approval will also change the acl
to the 'loanApproved' acl retrieved in Assignment 7

View input fields regards to loanStatus trait(`loanreviewstatus`) are bound to the loanStatus object in the controller
which stores all the `loanreviewstatus` trait info
like the `vm.loanStatus.isApproved` (`vm` being an alias for the controller) for the loan `isApproved` input field below+
`src/modules/contentEdit/contentEdit.html`
[source,html]
  <md-radio-group ng-model="vm.loanStatus.isApproved" ng-required="vm.isLoanOfficer" ng-disabled="!vm.isLoanOfficer">
    <div class="md-radio-group-label-wrapper">
      <label class="md-radio-group-label">Is Approved:</label>
    </div>
    <md-radio-button ng-value="true">
      Yes
    </md-radio-button>
    <md-radio-button ng-value="false">
      No
    </md-radio-button>
  </md-radio-group>
    ...
    <md-button class="md-primary" ng-disabled="contentForm.$invalid || loanForm.$invalid || approvalForm.$invalid" ng-click="vm.saveContent()">
      Save
    </md-button>

=== Controller
`src/modules/import/import.controller.js` +
In the content edit controller we create a `loanStatus` object which is bound to
the input fields in the view in the 'Approval' tab. +
We apply the trait object to the `newContent` when the save operation is invoked.
The objectService is then used to patch the object with the new trait. Finally the objectService is used
to update the object (using a REST PUT call) with the new acl (`loanApproved`).

[source,javascript]
    this.loanStatus = {
      reviewer: this.userProfile.email,
      isApproved: false,
      remarks: ""
    };


[source,javascript]
  saveContent() {
    if(this.isLoanOfficer){
      //Use Object service to patch object with traits
      this.objectService.patchObject(this.content, this.getLoanStatusTraitToPatch()).then((data) => {
        ...
        //udpate acl
        var content = data;
        if (this.loanApprovalAcl) {
          content.acl = this.loanApprovalAcl.id;
          this.objectService.updateObjectEx(content).then(data => {
            ...
          })
        }

[source,javascript]
  getLoanStatusTraitToPatch() {
    return {
      traits: {
        loanreviewstatus: {
          statustrait: this.loanStatus
        }
      }
    }
  }




=== Service
==== Assignment:
The following function is to patch an object and return the response item.
Right now it returns the same item as received.
Details of the required implementation are in the function comments

Location: `src/services/object.service.js`
[source,javascript]
    /**
     * TODO Assignment
     * Get the self link for the object from the REST resource for the object
     * Invoke a http PATCH using the url with the data to be patched as the PATCH data
     *      Modify the url to use the local nodejs proxy at localhost:3434
     *      instead of directly hitting the CMS at localhost:8080
     *      hint - use switchToProxyUrl convenience method in this class
     * @param object
     * @param patch
     * @returns {*|Promise.<TResult>}
     */
    patchObject(object: Object, patch: Object) {
      return this.$q.resolve(object);
    }

The following function is to update an existing object and return the response item.
Right now it returns the same item as received.
Details of the required implementation are in the function comments

[source,javascript]
    /**
     * TODO Assignment
     * Get the self link for the object from the REST resource for the object
     * Invoke a http PUT on the same with the modified object
     *      (object sent as the param for this method is already modified) in the PUT data
     *      Modify the url to use the local nodejs proxy at localhost:3434
     *      instead of directly hitting the CMS at localhost:8080
     * @param object Modified object with the rest resource links as retrieved when fetching the object from a REST call
     * @returns {*|Promise.<TResult>}
     */
    updateObjectEx(object: Object) {
      return this.$q.resolve(object);
    }
