     * 1. Use the GET method on the 'items' link of the folder resource
     * 2. Modify the url to set a filter on the owner field to the current user's email (present in the user object)
     *      Modify the url to use the local nodejs proxy at localhost:3434
     *      instead of directly hitting the CMS at localhost:8080
     *      hint - use switchToProxyUrl convenience method in this class
     * 3. Return the response data items (data._embedded.itemResourceList)
     *
     * @param folder
     * @param user
     * @returns {*}
