== Assignment 5

Create Loan Content

In this assignment, we're going to create a file type in CMS with the blob created from assignment 3
as a rendition attached and also applying the 'loanApplication' acl as well as the 'loan' trait info.
Assignment 3 helped to upload the file and get a reference to it. This exercise will allow to complete the
loan content creation from the import dialog.

=== View
In the application, the dialog to create loan content is shown when the logged in user clicks on the context menu option
for 'Create Loan Content' displayed on right-click of a folder
The user can select a file to upload and then click the finish button to upload the file and save the content.

View input fields regards to trait are bound to the loanTrait object in the controller which stores all the loan trait info
like the `vm.loanTrait.loanAmount` (`vm` being an alias for the controller) for the loan amount input field below+
`src/modules/import/import.html`
[source,html]
    <md-input-container flex>
        <label>Loan amount:</label>
        <input ng-model="vm.loanTrait.loanAmount" required>
    </md-input-container>
    ...
    <md-button class="md-primary" ng-disabled="contentForm.$invalid || loanForm.$invalid" ng-click="vm.saveContent()">
        Save
    </md-button>

=== Controller
`src/modules/import/import.controller.js` +
In the import controller we initialize a `newContent` file object, create a `loanTrait` object which is bound to
the input fields in the view. +
We apply the trait object to the `newContent` when the save operation is invoked.
After we have uploaded the file to the blob service we update the info on the `newContent` object before calling the
folderService to add the `newContent` item to the parent folder on which the import dialog was invoked.

[source,javascript]
    this.newContent = {
        name : '',
        description : '',
        type: 'file',
        acl: 'xxxxxxxxxxx',
        "versionLabel": [
            "INITIAL"
        ],
        "traits": {},
        "renditions": []
    };
    this.loanTrait = {};


[source,javascript]
    applyLoanTraitToContent() {
        this.newContent.traits.loan = {
            "loantrait" : this.loanTrait
        }
    }

[source,javascript]
    saveContent() {
        if (this.contentFiles) {
            this.applyLoanTraitToContent();
            ...
            this.contentService.uploadFile(this.contentFiles)
                .then((items) => {
                    if (Array.isArray(items) && items.length == 1) {
                        var blobContent = items[0];
                        this.updateNewContentWithBlobInfo(blobContent);
                        this.folderService.addItem(this.folder, this.newContent).then((item) => {
                            this.dialog.hide(true, item);
                        })
                    }
                })
                ...
        }
    }

[source,javascript]
    updateNewContentWithBlobInfo(blobContent) {
        this.newContent.renditions.push({
            "name": this.versionDescription,
            "mimeType": blobContent.content.properties.contentType, //like "application/pdf" : take this from blob response
            "contentSize": blobContent.content.properties.size,   // like 49685: content size coming from the previous blob response
            "blobId": blobContent.id,  // comes from the previous blob response of upload and the field "uri"
            "renditionType": this.renditionType
        });
    }

[source,javascript]
    applyLoanTraitToContent() {
        this.newContent.traits.loan = {
            "loantrait" : this.loanTrait
        }
    }



=== Service
==== Assignment:
The following function is to add an item to a folder and return the response item. Right now it returns empty.
Details of the required implementation are in the function comments

Location: `src/services/folder.service.js`
[source,javascript]
    /**
     * TODO Assignment : Implement this method
     * 1. Use the POST method on the 'items' link of the folder resource
     *      Modify the url to use the local nodejs proxy at localhost:3434
     *      instead of directly hitting the CMS at localhost:8080
     *      hint - use switchToProxyUrl convenience method in this class
     * 2. Return the response data
     * @param folder
     * @param item
     * @returns {*}
     */
    addItem(folder: Object, item: Object) {
        return this.$q.resolve({});
    }
